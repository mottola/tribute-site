            <!-- WRITE ABOUT WHAT MUSK MEANS TO YOU, AND HOW HE HAS INSPIRED YOU. WRITE WHAT KIND OF FUTURE YOU FORSEE THANKS SOLELY TO MUSK -->
            <p>Elon musk is one of the greatest inspirations to mankind. He embodies what truly driven beings can be capable of. Despite a rough childhood and difficult circumstances, Elon has never stopped pushing himself, never given up on his dreams, and never stopped learning.</p>
             <p>There is not a fiber within Elon which would accept that something can not be accomplished, or that an idea is too big for our species' current place in time. Elon has never seemed to need direction in life, only seeking advice from those who had also achieved greatness. From an early age Elon was different, choosing to read books in isolation for hours on end while other children played amongst each other without worry. 
             <p>Elon developed a vision for improving humanity from a very early age. He has never taken his focus off of that vision. A born problem solver, Elon continues to redefine what it means to be an engineer, an entrepreneur, and an innovator.</p>
             <p>One impossibility after another has been shattered by Musk's reserve. It was believed that reliance on oil was a fact of life which could not be avoided for many years to come. Elon has proven otherwise, creating the worlds first completely electric vehicle. Additionally, with the affordability of the Tesla Model III, fully electic vehicles will take the world by storm in the very near future, with them bringing the oil industry to its knees. Elon, despite nearly going bankrupt, persevered and found a way to make his vision of Tesla a reality. His success in the car industry will also have a direct and profound impact on addressing global warming issues via carbon emissions. Every human that is financially capable should invest in a Tesla.</p>
             <p>Another claimed <em>"impossibility"</em> was that rockets and space operations were too complex and expensive to be handled by a privatized, non-governmental entity. Musk has done amazing things on his journey to prove otherwise, things that will change mankind forever. After again nearing failure and bankruptcy, Elon and SpaceX rose from near ashes to win government contracts and deliver cargo to the ISS. Since then, SpaceX has expanded into creating unbelievable technologies never thought possible, such as re-landing and re-using a rocket. Elon and SpaceX successfully did what many claimed to be impossible when they landed the Falcon 9 rocket on just the <em>fourth</em> attempt at doing so, <em>post</em> obrit. Musk also wants to begin the colonization and terraforming of Mars, and while many scoff at such an idea, there is no doubt Elon will give it his all. 
             <p>Elon Musk has, and will continue to push the boundaries and capabilities of our species. There is no doubt that our generation is in the company of a legendary innovator, and appreciation for Elon's accomplishments will only become more profound as time goes on. The impact that one person can make in this world has been shown in pulses througout history, and Elon Musk will undoubtedly join the ranks of the amazing minds which have graced our kind. It is people like Elon that give our society inspiration. In a time where we no longer have faith in our leaders, where being a dreamer is shunned, and where pushing the limits of our comfort zone is contraindicated by society, we <strong><em>need</em></strong> people like Elon. We should hope that our children look up to and are inspired by individuals like him. I hope that Elon continues his relentless innovation, and if I am lucky enough to step foot on Mars in my lifetime, it is to Elon and Elon only that I will owe my eternal gratitude, for many men can dream, but Elon Musk make dreams into reality. For that, he is my personal hero.
